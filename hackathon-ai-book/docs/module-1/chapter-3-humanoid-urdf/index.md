# Chapter 3: Humanoid URDF - Modeling Bipedal Robots

## Overview
This chapter explores the creation and implementation of Unified Robot Description Format (URDF) models for humanoid robots. We'll cover the fundamentals of URDF, advanced modeling techniques for bipedal systems, and integration with ROS 2 tools for simulation and visualization. This chapter is designed for robotics engineers and researchers working on humanoid robot development.

## Learning Objectives
- Understand URDF fundamentals and XML structure
- Model complex humanoid robot kinematics
- Implement dynamic properties for realistic simulation
- Use Xacro for parameterized and modular URDF definitions
- Integrate URDF with Gazebo and RViz
- Validate and debug URDF models

## Chapter Structure
This chapter is organized into several key areas of humanoid URDF modeling:

1. [URDF Fundamentals and Basic Structure](lesson-1-urdf-fundamentals.md)
2. [Modeling Humanoid Kinematics](lesson-2-humanoid-kinematics.md)
3. [Advanced URDF Features and Xacro](lesson-3-advanced-features-xacro.md)
4. [Simulation and Visualization](lesson-4-simulation-visualization.md)

Each lesson builds upon the previous one, providing a comprehensive understanding of humanoid robot modeling in ROS 2.

## Prerequisites
- Understanding of ROS 2 core concepts (Nodes, Topics, Services)
- Basic knowledge of robotics kinematics
- Familiarity with XML syntax
- Understanding of 3D coordinate systems and transformations

## Chapter Summary
In this chapter, you've learned how to create sophisticated URDF models for humanoid robots, from basic structure to advanced simulation integration. You've explored the tools and techniques necessary to accurately model bipedal robot systems for both simulation and real-world applications.
