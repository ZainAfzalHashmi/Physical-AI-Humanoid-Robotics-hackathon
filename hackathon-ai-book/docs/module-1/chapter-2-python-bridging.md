# Chapter 2: Python Bridging with rclpy

## Overview
This chapter covers connecting Python agents to ROS controllers using rclpy, the Python client library for ROS 2. You'll learn how to bridge high-level AI agents with ROS-based robot controllers.

## Learning Objectives
- Understand the rclpy library and its capabilities
- Implement Python agents that communicate with ROS systems
- Create bridges between high-level decision-making and low-level control
- Combine topic and service patterns in agent implementations

## Chapter Structure
This chapter will include lessons on:
- Introduction to rclpy
- Python Agent Architecture
- Topic-Based Control Implementation
- Service-Based Control Implementation
- Combining Both Patterns

## Prerequisites
- Understanding of Chapter 1 concepts (nodes, topics, services)
- Proficiency in Python programming
- Basic understanding of AI/ML concepts

This chapter builds on the communication patterns learned in Chapter 1 and applies them to creating intelligent agents that can control robotic systems.
