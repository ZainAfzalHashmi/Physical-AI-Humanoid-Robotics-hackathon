# Chapter 1: ROS 2 Core - Nodes, Topics, Services

## Overview
This chapter introduces readers to the fundamental concepts of ROS 2, focusing on the core communication patterns that form the backbone of any robotic system. The chapter is designed for robotics engineers and advanced CS students who need practical knowledge of ROS 2 implementation.

## Learning Objectives
- Understand the ROS 2 architecture and node-based design
- Implement basic ROS 2 nodes in Python
- Master the publisher-subscriber communication pattern (Topics)
- Master the client-server communication pattern (Services)
- Execute essential ROS 2 CLI commands for system management

## Chapter Structure
This chapter is divided into three lessons:

1. [Introduction to ROS 2 Architecture and Nodes](lesson-1-intro-architecture.md)
2. [Publisher-Subscriber Pattern (Topics)](lesson-2-pub-sub-pattern.md)
3. [Client-Server Pattern (Services)](lesson-3-client-server-pattern.md)

Each lesson builds upon the previous one, providing a comprehensive understanding of ROS 2's core communication mechanisms.

## Prerequisites
- Basic understanding of Python programming
- Familiarity with command line interfaces
- Understanding of basic robotics concepts

## Chapter Summary
In this chapter, you've learned the foundational concepts of ROS 2, including nodes, topics, and services. You've implemented basic communication patterns and practiced with essential CLI commands. These skills form the foundation for more advanced robotics development covered in subsequent chapters.

## Next Steps
Proceed to the first lesson to begin exploring the ROS 2 architecture and creating your first nodes.
