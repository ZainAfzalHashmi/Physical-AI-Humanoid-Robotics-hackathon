# Chapter 3: Humanoid URDF

## Overview
This chapter covers Robot Description Format (URDF) and XML Macros (Xacro) for humanoid robots. You'll learn how to define robot models with links, joints, and physical properties for simulation and control.

## Learning Objectives
- Understand URDF and Xacro for robot modeling
- Define links and joint properties for humanoid robots
- Create a complete 3-DOF limb example
- Apply best practices for humanoid robot modeling
- Validate robot models for simulation and control

## Chapter Structure
This chapter will include lessons on:
- Introduction to URDF and Xacro
- Links and Joint Definitions
- Complete 3-DOF Limb Example
- Material and Visual Properties
- Physical Parameters and Inertial Properties

## Prerequisites
- Understanding of Chapter 1 concepts (ROS 2 communication)
- Basic knowledge of robotics kinematics
- Understanding of 3D coordinate systems

This chapter provides the foundation for modeling humanoid robots that can be used in simulation environments and with ROS-based control systems.
