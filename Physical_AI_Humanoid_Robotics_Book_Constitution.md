# Physical AI & Humanoid Robotics Book Constitution

## Vision
To create an accessible, hands-on learning resource that empowers beginners and intermediate learners to understand, build, and work with Physical AI and Humanoid Robotics systems through practical, real-world examples and projects.

## Core Principles

### I. Hands-On Learning First
Learning through doing: Every concept is reinforced with practical exercises, code examples, and build projects. Theory is introduced only to support practical application, ensuring readers can immediately implement and experiment with Physical AI and robotics concepts.

### II. Beginner-to-Intermediate Accessibility
Content must be approachable for beginners while providing sufficient depth for intermediate learners. Complex concepts are broken down into digestible steps with clear prerequisites, intuitive explanations, and progressive complexity building.

### III. Docusaurus Documentation Excellence
All content follows Docusaurus best practices for documentation: structured navigation, search functionality, versioning support, responsive design, and accessibility standards. Documentation serves as both learning material and reference.

### IV. Practical Implementation Focus
Every chapter includes runnable code examples, hardware integration guides, and project-based learning. No concept is presented without showing how it works in real Physical AI and robotics applications with actual implementation details.

### V. Technology Stack Clarity
Focus on industry-standard tools and frameworks: ROS/ROS2, Python/C++ for robotics, simulation environments (Gazebo, PyBullet), AI frameworks (PyTorch/TensorFlow), and hardware platforms (NVIDIA Jetson, etc.) with clear setup and usage instructions.

### VI. Open Source Community Values
Content encourages contribution, sharing, and collaborative learning. Code examples are licensed appropriately, hardware designs are open when possible, and community resources are highlighted to foster collaborative development.
